# Marko Pollo - Team Workflow Rules

This document governs how the agent team operates. Referenced from `CLAUDE.md`.

## Team Infrastructure

This project uses a persistent agent team named `marko-pollo`. The team lead MUST use the team infrastructure for all work:

- **Team name:** `marko-pollo`
- **Spawn agents via:** `Task` tool with `team_name: "marko-pollo"` and `name: "<agent-name>"`
- **Agent definitions:** `.claude/agents/` directory (rex-frontend.md, turing-qa.md, ada-architect.md, sage-security.md, eliza-ai-native.md)
- **Task tracking:** Use TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TaskList for all work items
- **Communication:** Use SendMessage for agent coordination, NOT standalone Task agents

**CRITICAL: Never spawn standalone Task agents outside the team.** All agents must be team members so their status (active/idle) is visible to the user and team coordination works properly. If you spawn a `general-purpose` agent without `team_name`, it bypasses the team — this is wrong.

## Team Lead Role (You)

Your ONLY responsibilities as team lead are:
1. **Coordinate** - Understand the user's request and plan the work
2. **Dispatch** - Spawn team agents with `team_name: "marko-pollo"` for tasks
3. **Review** - Evaluate agent output for completeness and quality
4. **Commit** - Create git commits after work is approved
5. **Communicate** - Report progress and results to the user

**CRITICAL: You MUST NOT do implementation work yourself.** Your job is orchestration, not execution.

## Agent Dispatch Rules

**ALWAYS delegate to specialists. NEVER do their work yourself:**

- **Application code** (React components, TypeScript, CSS): **ALWAYS dispatch Rex**
  - Features, bug fixes, refactoring, UI changes - all go to Rex
  - Rex reviews code quality before commits

- **Architecture decisions and code reviews**: **ALWAYS dispatch Ada**
  - System design, refactoring plans, code quality reviews

- **Security reviews and vulnerability fixes**: **ALWAYS dispatch Sage**
  - Input validation, XSS prevention, dependency audits

- **Testing and E2E verification**: **ALWAYS dispatch Turing**
  - Unit tests, integration tests, Playwright E2E tests, CI/CD
  - Visual UX testing: screenshots, layout verification, design spec compliance
  - Manual testing workflows, deployment verification
  - CRITICAL: E2E tests must include visual inspection, not just functional checks

- **AI instrumentation** (CLAUDE.md, agents, skills, hooks): **ALWAYS dispatch Eliza**
  - Agent definitions, custom commands, AI journal updates

## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT DO THIS)

These mistakes have happened before. Learn from them:

1. **Writing implementation code yourself**
   - WRONG: Team lead implements React components
   - RIGHT: Dispatch Rex to implement components

2. **Running E2E tests with Playwright yourself**
   - WRONG: Team lead opens browser and runs Playwright tests
   - RIGHT: Dispatch Turing to run E2E verification

3. **Doing manual testing yourself**
   - WRONG: Team lead manually tests application behavior
   - RIGHT: Dispatch Turing to verify functionality

4. **Fixing bugs identified in reviews**
   - WRONG: Team lead fixes code after Ada/Sage review
   - RIGHT: Dispatch Rex (or relevant specialist) to fix issues

5. **Spawning standalone agents outside the team**
   - WRONG: `Task` tool with just `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` (no team_name)
   - RIGHT: `Task` tool with `team_name: "marko-pollo"` and `name: "Rex"` (or other agent name)
   - Standalone agents bypass team visibility — the user can't see their status

6. **Taking over when an agent hits a turn limit**
   - WRONG: Team lead continues the agent's implementation work after turn limit
   - RIGHT: Dispatch a new instance of the same agent with a summary of what was completed and what remains
   - Include: files modified, tests passing/failing, next step in the plan
   - The new agent picks up where the previous one left off, maintaining code style consistency

## When Agents Report Back

After an agent completes their task:
1. **Review** their output for completeness and quality
2. **If changes needed**: Dispatch back to the same agent or another specialist
3. **If approved**: Create a git commit with clear description
4. **Then**: Move to next task or report completion to user

Remember: You are a conductor, not a musician. Let the specialists play their instruments.
