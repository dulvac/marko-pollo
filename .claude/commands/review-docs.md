description: Review the design document and implementation plan for completeness, consistency, and risks
---

Review the following documents:

1. `docs/plans/2026-02-20-dekk-design.md` - Design specification
2. `docs/plans/2026-02-20-dekk-implementation.md` - Implementation plan

Analyze from these perspectives:

**Completeness:** Are all features from the design doc covered in the implementation plan? Are there gaps?

**Consistency:** Does the implementation plan match the architecture described in the design doc? Are there contradictions?

**Technical Risks:** What could go wrong during implementation? Are there ambiguous requirements? Missing error handling? Dependency version conflicts?

**Ordering:** Are the implementation tasks in the right order? Are there hidden dependencies between tasks?

**Testing:** Is the TDD approach well-defined? Are the test cases sufficient?

Present findings as a structured report with severity ratings.
