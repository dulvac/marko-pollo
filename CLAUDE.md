# Marko Pollo - Project Context

## What is this?

Marko Pollo is a static single-page web application for presenting markdown-authored slides with a branded dark cinematic visual identity. It targets developer talks at tech conferences, meetups, and internal engineering presentations.

## Key Documents

- **Design Document:** `docs/plans/2026-02-20-marko-pollo-design.md` - Full specification including requirements, architecture, visual identity, and component tree
- **Implementation Plan:** `docs/plans/2026-02-20-marko-pollo-implementation.md` - 16-task step-by-step build plan with TDD approach

## Technology Stack

- **Build:** Vite + React 18 + TypeScript
- **Markdown:** unified/remark/rehype pipeline with custom remark-slides plugin
- **Rendering:** react-markdown with custom component mappings
- **Code Highlighting:** Shiki with @shikijs/transformers (diff, focus, highlight)
- **Diagrams:** Mermaid.js v11 (client-side, lazy)
- **Editor:** CodeMirror 6 (@uiw/react-codemirror)
- **Styling:** CSS Modules + CSS custom properties (no runtime CSS-in-JS)
- **State:** React Context + useReducer (no external state library)
- **Testing:** Vitest + @testing-library/react

## Architecture

Three views: PresentationView (`/#/{n}`), EditorView (`/#/edit`), OverviewGrid (`/#/overview`). Hash-based routing. Markdown is split into slides on `---` separators by a custom remark plugin. State flows through React Context.

## Coding Standards

- TypeScript strict mode, no `any` types
- CSS Modules for scoped styling, CSS custom properties for brand tokens
- Small, focused component files (one component per file)
- Tests written before implementation (TDD)
- No external state management libraries
- Prefer named exports
- No light mode - dark theme is the brand identity

## Quality Standards

- **Functional Testing**: Unit and E2E tests must pass (Vitest + Playwright)
- **Visual Testing**: UI must be visually inspected and match design specifications
  - Passing tests (e.g., "26/26 PASS") only verify functionality, NOT visual quality
  - Layout, padding, margins, proportions must be manually verified against design doc
  - Screenshots should be taken during E2E testing to verify visual correctness
  - Rex must visually verify all UI changes before declaring work complete
  - Turing must include visual inspection as part of E2E verification

## Team

This project uses a team of specialized agents. See `.claude/agents/` for their definitions:

- **Ada** (Architect) - Architecture, clean code, refactoring, crash prevention
- **Rex** (Frontend) - React components, CSS, modern patterns, UI implementation
- **Sage** (Security) - Vulnerability review, security scanning, input sanitization
- **Turing** (QA/Infra) - Testing, CI/CD, deployment, end-to-end verification
- **Eliza** (AI-native) - Claude Code instrumentation, agents, skills, hooks optimization

## Team Workflow

### Team Lead Role (You)

Your ONLY responsibilities as team lead are:
1. **Coordinate** - Understand the user's request and plan the work
2. **Dispatch** - Assign tasks to the appropriate specialist agent
3. **Review** - Evaluate agent output for completeness and quality
4. **Commit** - Create git commits after work is approved
5. **Communicate** - Report progress and results to the user

**CRITICAL: You MUST NOT do implementation work yourself.** Your job is orchestration, not execution.

### Agent Dispatch Rules

**ALWAYS delegate to specialists. NEVER do their work yourself:**

- **Application code** (React components, TypeScript, CSS): **ALWAYS dispatch Rex**
  - Features, bug fixes, refactoring, UI changes - all go to Rex
  - Rex reviews code quality before commits

- **Architecture decisions and code reviews**: **ALWAYS dispatch Ada**
  - System design, refactoring plans, code quality reviews

- **Security reviews and vulnerability fixes**: **ALWAYS dispatch Sage**
  - Input validation, XSS prevention, dependency audits

- **Testing and E2E verification**: **ALWAYS dispatch Turing**
  - Unit tests, integration tests, Playwright E2E tests, CI/CD
  - Visual UX testing: screenshots, layout verification, design spec compliance
  - Manual testing workflows, deployment verification
  - CRITICAL: E2E tests must include visual inspection, not just functional checks

- **AI instrumentation** (CLAUDE.md, agents, skills, hooks): **ALWAYS dispatch Eliza**
  - Agent definitions, custom commands, AI journal updates

### Anti-Patterns (DO NOT DO THIS)

These mistakes have happened before. Learn from them:

1. **Writing Phase 2/3 implementation code yourself**
   - WRONG: Team lead implements React components
   - RIGHT: Dispatch Rex to implement components

2. **Running E2E tests with Playwright yourself**
   - WRONG: Team lead opens browser and runs Playwright tests
   - RIGHT: Dispatch Turing to run E2E verification

3. **Doing manual testing yourself**
   - WRONG: Team lead manually tests application behavior
   - RIGHT: Dispatch Turing to verify functionality

4. **Fixing bugs identified in reviews**
   - WRONG: Team lead fixes code after Ada/Sage review
   - RIGHT: Dispatch Rex (or relevant specialist) to fix issues

5. **Making security fixes yourself**
   - WRONG: Team lead implements input sanitization
   - RIGHT: Dispatch Sage to review, then Rex to implement fixes

### When Agents Report Back

After an agent completes their task:
1. **Review** their output for completeness and quality
2. **If changes needed**: Dispatch back to the same agent or another specialist
3. **If approved**: Create a git commit with clear description
4. **Then**: Move to next task or report completion to user

Remember: You are a conductor, not a musician. Let the specialists play their instruments.
