description: Spin up the full Marko Pollo team to review the current state of the project
---

Assemble the Marko Pollo development team for a comprehensive review of the project's current state.

Spawn the following agents as a team and have each review from their specialty:

1. **Ada** (Architect) - Review architecture, component boundaries, data flow, crash risks
2. **Rex** (Frontend) - Review React patterns, component quality, CSS, visual fidelity
3. **Sage** (Security) - Review for vulnerabilities, XSS risks, dependency safety
4. **Turing** (QA) - Review test coverage, CI config, build correctness, edge cases
5. **Eliza** (AI-native) - Review Claude Code instrumentation, CLAUDE.md accuracy, agent definitions

Each agent should read the design doc and implementation plan, then review the current codebase from their perspective. Collect all findings and present a consolidated report.
