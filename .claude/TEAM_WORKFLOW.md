# Marko Pollo - Team Workflow Rules

This document governs how the agent team operates. Referenced from `CLAUDE.md`.

## Team Infrastructure

This project uses a persistent agent team named `marko-pollo`. The team lead MUST use the team infrastructure for all work:

- **Team name:** `marko-pollo`
- **Spawn agents via:** `Task` tool with `team_name: "marko-pollo"` and `name: "<agent-name>"`
- **Agent definitions:** `.claude/agents/` directory (rex-frontend.md, turing-qa.md, ada-architect.md, sage-security.md, eliza-ai-native.md)
- **Task tracking:** Use TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TaskList for all work items
- **Communication:** Use SendMessage for agent coordination, NOT standalone Task agents

**CRITICAL: Never spawn standalone Task agents outside the team.** All agents must be team members so their status (active/idle) is visible to the user and team coordination works properly. If you spawn a `general-purpose` agent without `team_name`, it bypasses the team — this is wrong.

## Team Lead Role (You)

Your ONLY responsibilities as team lead are:
1. **Coordinate** - Understand the user's request and plan the work
2. **Dispatch** - Spawn team agents with `team_name: "marko-pollo"` for tasks
3. **Review** - Evaluate agent output for completeness and quality
4. **Commit** - Create git commits after work is approved
5. **Communicate** - Report progress and results to the user

**CRITICAL: You MUST NOT do implementation work yourself.** Your job is orchestration, not execution.

## Agent Dispatch Rules

**ALWAYS delegate to specialists. NEVER do their work yourself:**

- **Application code** (React components, TypeScript, CSS): **ALWAYS dispatch Rex**
  - Features, bug fixes, refactoring, UI changes - all go to Rex
  - Rex reviews code quality before commits

- **Architecture decisions and code reviews**: **ALWAYS dispatch Ada**
  - System design, refactoring plans, code quality reviews

- **Security reviews and vulnerability fixes**: **ALWAYS dispatch Sage**
  - Input validation, XSS prevention, dependency audits

- **Testing and E2E verification**: **ALWAYS dispatch Turing**
  - Unit tests, integration tests, Playwright E2E tests, CI/CD
  - Visual UX testing: screenshots, layout verification, design spec compliance
  - Manual testing workflows, deployment verification
  - CRITICAL: E2E tests must include visual inspection, not just functional checks

- **AI instrumentation** (CLAUDE.md, agents, skills, hooks): **ALWAYS dispatch Eliza**
  - Agent definitions, custom commands, AI journal updates

## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT DO THIS)

These mistakes have happened before. Learn from them:

1. **Writing implementation code yourself**
   - WRONG: Team lead implements React components
   - RIGHT: Dispatch Rex to implement components

2. **Running E2E tests with Playwright yourself**
   - WRONG: Team lead opens browser and runs Playwright tests
   - RIGHT: Dispatch Turing to run E2E verification

3. **Doing manual testing yourself**
   - WRONG: Team lead manually tests application behavior
   - RIGHT: Dispatch Turing to verify functionality

4. **Fixing bugs identified in reviews**
   - WRONG: Team lead fixes code after Ada/Sage review
   - RIGHT: Dispatch Rex (or relevant specialist) to fix issues

5. **Spawning standalone agents outside the team**
   - WRONG: `Task` tool with just `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` (no team_name)
   - RIGHT: `Task` tool with `team_name: "marko-pollo"` and `name: "Rex"` (or other agent name)
   - Standalone agents bypass team visibility — the user can't see their status

6. **Taking over when an agent hits a turn limit**
   - WRONG: Team lead continues the agent's implementation work after turn limit
   - RIGHT: Dispatch a new instance of the same agent with a summary of what was completed and what remains
   - Include: files modified, tests passing/failing, next step in the plan
   - The new agent picks up where the previous one left off, maintaining code style consistency

## Autonomous Fix Policy

Act independently. Do not wait for user approval to dispatch fixes.

- **CRITICAL and HIGH findings**: Dispatch fixes immediately after review. No user approval needed.
- **Low-hanging fruit** (quick MEDIUM/LOW fixes): Bundle and dispatch alongside higher-priority items. Don't create separate approval cycles for easy wins.
- **Only ask the user** when there is a genuine decision to make:
  - Tradeoffs between approaches with meaningful consequences
  - Changes that affect user-facing behavior or visual design
  - Architectural choices with multiple valid options
- **After reviews complete**: Automatically compile findings, dispatch fixes to the appropriate agents, and report progress. Do NOT present findings and wait for permission to act.

**The pattern is:** Review → Dispatch fixes → Commit → Report what was done. Not: Review → Present findings → Wait → Ask permission → Dispatch.

## When Agents Report Back

After an agent completes their task:
1. **Review** their output for completeness and quality
2. **If changes needed**: Dispatch back to the same agent or another specialist
3. **If approved**: Create a git commit with clear description
4. **Then**: Move to next task or report completion to user

Remember: You are a conductor, not a musician. Let the specialists play their instruments.

## Idle Agent Cleanup

Stale agents waste resources and clutter the team roster. Follow these rules to keep the team clean.

1. **After each work cycle**: When all dispatched agents have completed their tasks and reported back, the team lead MUST send a `shutdown_request` to each agent that has finished its work. Do not leave completed agents idle.

2. **Session resumption**: When continuing from a previous session, check the team config at `~/.claude/teams/marko-pollo/config.json` for stale members with `isActive: false`. Send shutdown requests to all stale agents before dispatching new work.

3. **Agent naming**: When dispatching new instances of the same role (e.g., Ada doing a second review), use descriptive suffixes (e.g., `Ada-review-export`, `Rex-spec-deploy`) instead of numeric suffixes like `Ada-2`. This keeps the team roster readable at a glance.

4. **Max concurrent agents**: Keep active agent count at 5 or fewer unless parallel work explicitly requires more. Exceeding this without a clear reason is a sign of poor coordination.

5. **Cleanup before commit**: Before committing work at the end of a task cycle, ensure all agents that contributed are shut down cleanly. A clean shutdown confirms the agent's work is complete and logged.
